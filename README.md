##Results

A KNN classifier was tried, but it only yielded an accuracy of 64.1%

Much better success was found using SVM. Initially, various combinations of X values were tried, but the highest accuracy achieved was 49.2%.

Next, all available X values were tried, including the error values. With a linear kernal, we obtained a testing accuracy of 89%. Other kernals were attempted but none of them could beat the linear model.
